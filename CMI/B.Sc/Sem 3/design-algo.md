## What are algorithms
Input $\to$ Output

## Properties of Algorithm

1. ***Input:*** Zero or more objects from a well-defined set.
2. ***Output:*** One or more objects from a well-defined set must have a specifies relation to inputs. 
3. ***Finiteness:***  Runs in a finite amount of time. 
4. ***Definiteness:*** Each step is well-defined (no ambiguity).
5. ***Effectiveness:*** Each steps is suffieciently well-defined that it in principle can be executed in pen and paper.
