\begin{problem}{Applications of Noether’s Theorem: 5.37}{}

	$C$ , with the operation $\oplus$, forms an abelian group, with the point $O$
	being the identity.
		\parinn
		
	Suppose $O$ is a flex on $C$ in the above proposition.  
	
	\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
		\item Show that the flexes form a subgroup of $C$; as an abelian group, this subgroup is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z} /(3) \times \mathbb{Z} /(3)$.
		\item  Show that the flexes are exactly the elements of order three in the group. (i.e., exactly those elements $P$ such that $P \oplus P \oplus P=O$ ). 
		\item Show that a point $P$ is of order two in the group if and only if the tangent to $C$ at $P$ passes through $O$. 
		\item Let
	$C=Y^2Z-X(X-Z)(X-\lambda Z)$, $\lambda \neq  0, 1$, $O=[0:1:0]$. Find the points of order two. 
		\item Show that the points of order two on a nonsingular cubic form a group isomorphic
		to $\bbZ /(2)\times \bbZ/(2)$
		\item Let $C$ be a nonsingular cubic, $P \in C$. How many lines through $P$ are tangent to $C$ at some point $Q \neq P$ ? (The answer depends on whether $P$ is a flex.)
	\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

\solve{\begin{enumerate}
		\item[(d)] Let $P$ be a point   of order 2. Let $P\in U_2\implies P=(a,1,c)$. If $c=0\implies a=0$ so, $c\neq 0$. Let $L$ be the tangent of $(a,c)$ at $C_*$. As $P$ is order $2\implies L$ passes through $(0,0)$. Let $X=mZ$ be the equation of $L$.

Now $M\neq \infty$ (then  $Z=0$ be the equation of $L$ which is the tangent at $(0,1,0)$. So, $a=mc$. Now, \begin{equation}
	c=a(a-c)(a-\lambda c)\implies c=mc(mc-c)(mc-\lambda c) \implies c^2m(m-1)(m-\lambda)=1
	\label{eq1}
\end{equation}
So, $$c^2=\frac1{(m(m-1)(m-\lambda)}\quad [\text{as }(m(m-1)(m-\lambda)\neq 0] \dots(\text{by }\ref{eq1})$$ So, $c$ has two distinct values  which implies $L$ intersect $C_*$ in three distinct points which is not possible. So, $P\notin U_2$. So, $P=(a,0,c)=(m,0,1)\implies m=0,1,\lambda $ tangent at $(m,0,1)$ is $X=mZ\  \forall\ m\in \{0,1,\lambda\}$ and the tangent passes through $(0,1,0)$. So there are 3 points of order 2.\Qed

\item[(e)] So, any non-singular irreducible curve  is projectively equivalent to the equation given in $(c)$. So, the group has 4 point. So, it is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}/(2)\times\mathbb{Z}/(2)$\\
