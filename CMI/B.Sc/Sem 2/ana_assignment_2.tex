		%Problem		
		If $f(0,0)=0$ and
		$$
		f(x, y)=\frac{x y}{x^{2}+y^{2}} \quad \text { if }(x, y) \neq(0,0)
		$$
		prove that $\left(D_{1} f\right)(x, y)$ and $\left(D_{2} f\right)(x, y)$ exist at every point of $R^{2}$, although $f$ is not continuous at $(0,0)$.
	\end{problem}
	
	\sol{When $(x,y)\neq 0$ then $$(D_1f)(x,y)=\frac{y(y^2-x^2)}{(x^2+y^2)^2}\text{ and }(D_2f)(X,y)=\frac{x(x^2-y^2)}{(x^2+y^2)^2}$$Now at $(0,0)$ \begin{align*}
		(D_1f)(0,0) & =\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{f(h,0)-f(0,0)}{|h|}              & (D_2f)(0,0) & =\lim_{k\to0} \frac{f(0,k)-f(0,0)}{|k|}                \\
		            & =\lim_{h\to0}\frac{\frac{h\times 0}{h^2+0} - 0}{|h|} &             & = \lim_{k\to 0}\frac{\frac{0\times k}{0+k^2} - 0}{|k|} \\
		            & =\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{0}{|h|}                          &             & =\lim_{k\to 0}\frac{0}{|k|}                            \\
		            & =0                                                   &             & =0
	\end{align*}Hence $(D_1f)(x,y)$ and $(D_2f)(x,y)$ exists at every point of $\bbR^2$. 

Now if we approach $(0,0)$ along the line then it  approaches to 0. But if we approach $(0,0)$ along the line $y=x$ then $$\lim_{h\to 0}f(h,h)=\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{h^2}{2h^2}=\frac12$$ Hence $f$ is not continuous at (0,0)
