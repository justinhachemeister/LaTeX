		%Problem		
		If $f(0,0)=0$ and
		$$
		f(x, y)=\frac{x y}{x^{2}+y^{2}} \quad \text { if }(x, y) \neq(0,0)
		$$
		prove that $\left(D_{1} f\right)(x, y)$ and $\left(D_{2} f\right)(x, y)$ exist at every point of $R^{2}$, although $f$ is not continuous at $(0,0)$.
	\end{problem}
	
	\sol{When $(x,y)\neq (0,0)$ then $$(D_1f)(x,y)=\frac{y(y^2-x^2)}{(x^2+y^2)^2}\text{ and }(D_2f)(X,y)=\frac{x(x^2-y^2)}{(x^2+y^2)^2}$$Now at $(0,0)$ \begin{align*}
		(D_1f)(0,0) & =\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{f(h,0)-f(0,0)}{|h|}              & (D_2f)(0,0) & =\lim_{k\to0} \frac{f(0,k)-f(0,0)}{|k|}                \\
		            & =\lim_{h\to0}\frac{\frac{h\times 0}{h^2+0} - 0}{|h|} &             & = \lim_{k\to 0}\frac{\frac{0\times k}{0+k^2} - 0}{|k|} \\
		            & =\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{0}{|h|}                          &             & =\lim_{k\to 0}\frac{0}{|k|}                            \\
		            & =0                                                   &             & =0
	\end{align*}Hence $(D_1f)(x,y)$ and $(D_2f)(x,y)$ exists at every point of $\bbR^2$. 

Now if we approach $(0,0)$ along the line then it  approaches to 0. But if we approach $(0,0)$ along the line $y=x$ then $$\lim_{h\to 0}f(h,h)=\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{h^2}{2h^2}=\frac12$$ Hence $f$ is not continuous at (0,0)

		%Problem		
		Suppose that $f$ is a real-valued function defined in an open set $E \subset R^{n}$, and that the partial derivatives $D_{1} f, \ldots, D_{n} f$ are bounded in $E$. Prove that $f$ is continuous in $E$.\parinn
		
		Hint: Proceed as in the proof of Theorem 9.21.
	\end{problem}
	
	\sol{Let $a$ is any arbitrary point in $E$. Since $E$ is an open set there exists an open ball $B_r(a)$ centered at $a$ of radius $r>0$ inside $E$. We have to show that $\forall\ \epsilon>0$ $\exists \ \delta>0$ $|f(a+h)-f(a)|<\epsilon$ wherever $\|h\|<\delta$ where $a+h\in B_r(a)$. 
		
		Now any open ball $B_r(a)$ centered at $a$ of radius $r>0$ in $\bbR^n$ is a convex set. Because if we take any two points $x,y\in B_r(a)$ then for any $\theta\in (0,1)$ $$\|(\theta x+(1-\theta) y)-a\|=\|\theta (x-a)+(1-\theta)(y-a)\|\leq \theta\|x-a\|+(1-\theta)\|y-a\|< \theta r+(1-\theta )r=r$$and henceforth $\theta x+(1-\theta)y\in B_r(a)$. Therefore any open ball in $\bbR^n$ is a convex set.
		
		Now. Let $h=\sum\limits_{i=1}^n h_ie_i$ where $e_i$ is the $i-$th vector of the standard basis of $\bbR^m$. \begin{align*}
		f(a+h)-f(a) & =f\left(a+\sum_{i=1}^nh_ie_i\right)-f(a)                                                                                                                                                                                                      \\
		            & =\left[f\left(a+\sum_{i=1}^nh_ie_i\right)-f\left(a+\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}h_ie_i\right)\right]+\left[f\left(a+\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}h_ie_i\right)-f\left(a+\sum_{i=1}^{n-2}h_ie_i\right)\right]\\
		            & \qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad+\cdots+\left[f\left(a+h_1e_1\right)-f\left(a\right)\right] \\
		            & =\sum_{k=1}^n\left[f\left(a+\sum_{i=1}^kh_ie_i\right)-f\left(a+\sum_{i=1}^{k-1}h_ie_i\right)\right]
	\end{align*} Now each $f\left(a+\sum\limits_{i=1}^kh_ie_i\right)-f\left(a+\sum\limits_{i=1}^{k-1}h_ie_i\right)$ is a one-variable function from $\bbR$ to $\bbR$. By Mean Value Theorem $\exists \ \theta_k\in \left(0,1\right)$ such that $$f\left(a+\sum\limits_{i=1}^kh_ie_i\right)-f\left(a+\sum\limits_{i=1}^{k-1}h_ie_i\right)=\left.\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_k}\right|_{v_k}h_k$$where $v_k= a+\sum\limits_{i=1}^{k-1} h_ie_i+\theta_k h_k e_k$. Hence $$f(a+h)-f(a)=\sum_{i=1}^n \left.\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i}\right|_{v_i}h_i=\sum_{i=1}^nD_if(v_i)h_i$$Since all $D_if$ are bounded in, Let $D_if$ is bounded by $M_i$ where $M_i>0$. Then take $M=\max\{M_i\mid 1\leq i\ leq n\}$ Hence $\left|D_1(v_i)h_i\right|<M|h_i|$. Hence
	$$|f(a+h)-f(a)|=\left|\sum_{i=1}^nD_if(v_i)h_i\right|=\sum_{i=1}^kM|h_i|=M\|h\|_1$$Now as $h\to 0$ we can say $\|h\|_1\to 0$. Hence $M\|h\|_1\to 0$ Therefore $|f(a+h)-f(a)|\to 0$. Hence $\forall\ \epsilon>0$ $\exists\ \delta>0$ such that $\|h\|_1<\delta$ whenever $|f(a+h)-f(a)|<\epsilon$. Therefore $f$ is continuous in $E$}

	\sol{Let $u\in \bbR^n$ and $u$ is nonzero. Then consider the function $g(t)=x+tu$ which is a function from $\bbR$ to $\bbR^n$. Now $h=f\circ g$ is a $\bbR\to\bbR$ function and $h(t)=(f\circ g)(t)=f(x+ut)$. Hence $h$ has a maximum at $t=0$. Therefore $h'(0)=0$. Now by Chain Rule $h'(t)=f'(g(t))g'(t)=f'(g(t))u$. Hence $h'(0)=f'(g(0))u=f'(x)u$. Hence $f'(x)u=0$ since $u$ is nonzero $f'(x)=0$}

		%Problem
				If $f$ is a real function defined in a convex open set $E \subset R^{n}$, such that $\left(D_{1} f\right)(x)=0$ for every $x \in E$, prove that $f(x)$ depends only on $x_{2}, \ldots, x_{n}$.\parinn
				
				Show that the convexity of $E$ can be replaced by a weaker condition, but that some condition is required. For example, if $n=2$ and $E$ is shaped like a horseshoe, the statement may be false.
	\end{problem}
	
	\sol{To prove $f(x)$ depends only on $x_2,x_3,\cdots,x_n$ it is enough to show that $f(x,x_2,\cdots,x_n)=f(y,x_2,\cdots,x_n)$ where $(x,x_2,\cdots,x_n),(y,x_2,\cdots,x_n)\in E$. Hence for any $u\in (x,y)$ $(u,_2,\cdots,x_n)\in E$ as $E$ is convex. Now by Mean Value Theorem $f(x,x_2,\cdots,x_n)-f(y,x_2,\cdots,x_n)=(x-y)D_if(z,x_2,\cdots,x_n)$ for some $z\in (x,y)$. Given that $D_if(x)=0$ Hence $f(x,x_2,\cdots,x_n)-f(y,x_2,\cdots,x_n)=0$. Therefore $f(x)$ depends only on $x_{2}, \ldots, x_{n}$.
		
		We need the property where for fixed $x_2,\cdots,x_n$ if $(x,x_2,\cdots,x_n)$ and $(y,x_2,\cdots,x_n)$ are in $E$ then $E$ must contain the line segment joining $(x,x_2,\cdots,x_n)$ and $(y,x_2,\cdots,x_n)$. Hence we can say that if $E$ intersects any line parallel to $X-$axis then it should be an interval on that line.

	\sol{Let $f=\begin{bmatrix}
			f_1\\ f_2\\ f_3
		\end{bmatrix}$Given that $|f(t)|=1\implies f_1^2(t)+f_2^2(t)+f_3^2(t)=1$ for all $t\in \bbR$. Now $$0=\frac{d}{dt}|f(t)|^2=\frac{d}{dt}(f_1^(t)+f_2^2(t)+f_3^2(t))=2(f_1'(t)f_1(t)+f_2'(t)f_2(t)+f_3'(t)f_3(t))=2f'(t)\cdot f(t)$$Hence $f'(t)\cdot f(t)=0$ for all $t\in \bbR$.
	
	$f'(t)\cdot f(t)$ means the vector $f'(t)$ is perpendicular to $f(t)$. If $f(t)$ is the radius vector of a point on an unit sphere then $f'(t)$ is tangent vector on that point to the sphere
