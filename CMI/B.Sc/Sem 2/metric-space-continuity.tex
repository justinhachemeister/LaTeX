\section{Limit Point and Closure:-}

\dfn{Limit Point}{$S\subset X$ is a metric space. We say that $x\in X$ is a limit point of $S$ if $\exists$ a sequence $\{s_n\}$ with all $s_n\in S\setminus\{x\}$ such that $s_n\to x$ (each $s_n$ is different from $x$)}

\begin{Theorem}{}{limitpoint}	
	 $x$ is a limit point of $S$ $\iff$ every neighborhood of $x$ in $X$ contains a point of $S$ other than $S$.
\end{Theorem}
\begin{myproof}
	\subsubsection*{If Part:}
	Let $x$ be a limit point of $S$. Therefore take a sequence $\{s_n\}$ in $S\setminus \{x\}  $ with $s_n\to x$ . 
	
	To prove what we want it is enough to show that $B_r(x)\cap S$ contains a point other than $x$. As $s_n \to x$, $\exists $ $N$ s.t.  $\forall $ $n>N$ $d(x,s_n)<r$ i.e. $s_n\in B_r(x)$. In particular $s_n]in B_r(x)\cap (S\setminus \{x\})$
	\subsubsection*{Only If Part:}
	We need to produce  a sequence $\{s_n\} \in S\setminus \{x\}$ with $\lim s_n=x$. Take $s_n\in B_{\frac1n}(x)\cap (S\setminus \{x\})$ See that $\lim\limits_{n\to \infty}s_n=x$. This is essentially because $\frac1n\to 0$.
	
	Complete the rest of the proof.
	
\end{myproof}
\dfn{Closure}{Given a topological space $X$ and $S\subset X$, the closure of the set $S$ is $\overline{S}$ the smallest closed set containing $S$.}
\begin{Theorem}{}{closure}
	\begin{tabular}{rl}
	$\overline{S} $ & $=\text{Smallest closed set of } X\text{ containing }S $                                     = \setword{A}{A} \\
	                & $ =S\cup (\text{limit points of }S)$                                                         =                \setword{B}{B} \\
	                & $=\{x\in X\mid x=\lim\limits_{n\to \infty} \text{ for some sequence }\{s_n\} \text{ in }S\}$ =                \setword{C}{C} \\
	                & $=\{x\in X\mid \text{Every neighborhood of }x\text{ intersects }S\}$                         =                \setword{D}{D}
\end{tabular}
\end{Theorem}
\begin{myproof}
	\subsubsection*{$\bs{A\subset D}$}
		\begin{tabular}{l}\hspace{1.5cm}$A^c=\bigcup$ (All open set $V$ s.t. $V\cap S=\phi$) \\ \hspace{1.5cm}$D^c=\{x\in X\mid \exists \text{ open neighborhood of }x,B\text{ s.t. }B\cap S=\phi \}$\end{tabular}
		
		\setlength{\parindent}{0cm}Clearly for all $x\in D^c$, $x\in A^c$. Hence $D^c\subset A^c\implies A \subset D$\setlength{\parindent}{1cm}
		\subsubsection*{$\bs{D\subset B}$}
		Take $x\in D$. Suppose $x\notin S$. Now any neighborhood of $x$ intersects $S$ in a point hence it has to be a different point from $x$ since $x\notin S$. Therefore $x$ is a limit point of $S$. $D\subset B$
		\subsubsection*{$\bs{B\subset C}$}
		If $x\in S$ then take a sequence 
	
\end{myproof}

\qs{}{What does it mean to be smallest closed set containing the set $S$ here ?}
\sol $\bigcap$ All closed sets containing $S$ is automatically closed and hence the smallest closed set containing $S$.
\begin{myproof}
	For proof of \ref{th:closure} notice \ref{A},\ref{B},\ref{C},\ref{D} all contains $S$ (obvious).
	\nt{We don't need to show \ref{B},\ref{C},\ref{D} are closed. We can also take the sets element wise and show each set is a subset of the other. This may simplify our way of proof. (exercise)}
	
	Now see $A$ and $D$ completely deal with topology. \ref{A} is about closed sets and \ref{D} is about open sets. So \ref{A} and \ref{D} close to each other. Now by the \ref{th:limitpoint} we have equivalence of \ref{C} and \ref{D}. So we can prove like this
	$$\ref{A}\iff\ref{D}\iff\ref{B}\ \&\ \ref{C}$$Left as exercise
\end{myproof}\nt{For these kind of proofs instead of looking for the most efficient way try to find a path that allows you to go from anywhere to anywhere}
\section{Continuity:-}
\dfn{Continuity}{$f:X\to Y$ function between metric spaces is continuous at $a\in X$ if $\forall$ $\eps>0$ $\exists$ $\delta>0$ s.t. \begin{align*}
	d(x,a)<\delta      & \implies d(f(a),f(x))<\eps      \\
	\Updownarrow\qquad & \qquad\qquad\qquad \Updownarrow \\
	x\in B_{\delta}(x) & \implies f(x)\in B_{\eps}(f(a))
\end{align*}}
\setlength{\parindent}{0cm}That means $f^{-1}$(Any ball around $f(a)$) $\supset$ Ball around $a$.\setlength{\parindent}{1cm}

So $f:X\to Y$ is continuous at all points $\iff$ $f^{-1}(\text{Any ball intersecting the range})\supset $ A ball
\nt{We can not say $f^{-1}(\text{Any ball})$ because because we need a ball that contains a point in the range
}
\begin{Theorem}{}{}
	$f$ is continuous $\iff$ $f^{-1}(\text{Any open set in }Y)$ is open in $X$
\end{Theorem}
\begin{myproof}
	\subsubsection*{If Part:-}
	It is enough to show $f^{-1}(\text{Any ball})$ is open on $X$ because $f^{-1}$ preserves unions $f^{-1}\left(\bigcup\limits_{\alpha}V_{\alpha}\right)=\bigcup\limits_{\alpha}\left(f^{-1}(V_{\alpha})\right)$
	
	Let $B$ is any open set (as its conceptually simpler to take open set here instead of a ball) in $Y$. Let $a\in f^{-1}(B)$. Hence we can say $f(a)\in B$. Since $B$ is an open set we can say there is a ball $B_{\eps}(f(a))\subset B$. Since $f$ is continuous $\exists$ $\delta $ such that $f(x)\in B_{\eps}(f(a))$ whenever $x\in B_{\delta}(a)$. Now $f^{-1}(B)\supset f^{-1}\Big(B_{\eps}(f(a))\big)\supset B_{\delta}(a)$ Hence $f^{-1} (B)$ is open. 
	
	\subsubsection*{Only If Part:-}
	Lets prove continuity ar $a\in X$. We are given that $f^{-1}\Big(B_{\eps}(f(a))\Big)$ is open and obviously contains $a$. Therefore $f^{-1}\Big(B_{\eps}\big(f(a)\big)\Big)$ contains a ball around $a$. Take $\delta=$ Radius of the ball.
\end{myproof}
